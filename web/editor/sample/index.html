              This may be the first time you hear about this made-up disorder
              but it actually isn’t so far from the truth. Even the studies that
              were conducted almost half a century show that
              <strong
                >the language you speak has more effects on you than you
                realize</strong
              >.
            </p>

              One of the very first experiments conducted on this topic dates
              back to 1964.
              <a
                href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9440038_Language_and_TAT_content_in_bilinguals"
                >In the experiment</a
              >
              designed by linguist Ervin-Tripp who is an authority expert in
              psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic studies, adults who are
              bilingual in English in French were showed series of pictures and
              were asked to create 3-minute stories. In the end participants
              emphasized drastically different dynamics for stories in English
              and French.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another ground-breaking experiment which included bilingual
              Japanese women married to American men in San Francisco were asked
              to complete sentences. The goal of the experiment was to
              investigate whether or not human feelings and thoughts are
              expressed differently in
              <strong>different language mindsets</strong>. Here is a sample
              from the the experiment:
            </p>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th></th>
                  <th>English</th>
                  <th>Japanese</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Real friends should</td>
                  <td>Be very frank</td>
                  <td>Help each other</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>I will probably become</td>
                  <td>A teacher</td>
                  <td>A housewife</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>When there is a conflict with family</td>
                  <td>I do what I want</td>
                  <td>It's a time of great unhappiness</td>
                </tr>

              show, the language a person speaks affects their cognition,
              behaviour, emotions and hence <strong>their personality</strong>.
              This shouldn’t come as a surprise
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function"
                >since we already know</a
              >
              that different regions of the brain become more active depending
              on the person’s activity at hand. Since structure, information and
              especially <strong>the culture</strong> of languages varies
              substantially and the language a person speaks is an essential
              element of daily life.
